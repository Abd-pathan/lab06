THE LAB 06 IS ABOUT THE FILE OPERATIONS.
In the code file I have used various inbuild file related functions to perform the task.
Basically the program opens a file called as 'listings' and then it takes is two of its field 'host_name' and 'price' and then it sorts them using the predefined  qsort function and then it copies the sorted data to a new file.
